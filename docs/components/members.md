# Members

A component for displaying a grid of member logos, and linking to the members area of the website. It is part of the [business ecosystem](../templates/business-ecosystem.md) template.

<example title="Members grid" src="components/members.html.twig" />

## Considerations

The `cluster layout` used for the call-to-action within the members component (`.component--members__cta`) has been modified, so that the text before the links appears on a separate line below a viewport width of 768px.
