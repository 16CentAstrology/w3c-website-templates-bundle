# Access Control Banner

Access Control Banners are used to display information about the page access restrictions.
They are an enhancement of the banner component, and thus are placed in a `.global-header` element.

Different types of access control banners are available:
- `access-control-banner--member` - for member-only pages
- `access-control-banner--team` - for team-only pages
- `access-control-banner--user` - for pages restricted to the current user
- `access-control-banner--private` - for other access control restrictions

<example title="Access Control" src="components/access-control.html.twig" />
