# Footer

This example does not include a complete list of site links in the footer, as which links are included and how they are named can be changed. It only includes a home page link.

<example title="Footer" src="components/footer.html.twig" />

## Considerations

Note the use of the [center layout](../layouts/center.md) and [cluster layout](../layouts/cluster.md).

Also note the incidence of a `<span class="visuallyhidden">` to provide accessible text labels for icon links.
