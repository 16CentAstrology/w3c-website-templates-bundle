# Footer

This example does not reflect the full list of links shown on the live site, as which links are included and how they are named can be changed. It only includes a home page link.

<example title="Footer" src="components/footer.html.twig" />

## Considerations

Note the use of the [center layout](../layouts/center.md) and [cluster layout](../layouts/cluster.md).

Also note the incidence of a `<span class="visuallyhidden">` to provide accessible text labels for icon links.
