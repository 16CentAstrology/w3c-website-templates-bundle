# Getting started

_**Please note:** the design system is currently being updated while Studio 24 is working on the W3C redesign project. These
instructions are currently intended for W3C to test the design system. We plan to release a tagged version of the design
system once this work is done (November)._

The assets are automatically compiled and deployed on the W3C CDN under https://cdn.w3.org/templates/website-2021/. You may link to them directly in any types of projects.

_Todo: discuss strategy on the different environments (dev, staging and prod)
