# Home page template

An example of the home page template. It is broadly similar to the landing page template, with some minor differences as shown. This example does not include:

- the complete [global navigation](../components/navigation.md) as per the live site
- the complete list of site links for the [footer](../components/footer.md) as per the live site.

<example title="Home page" src="example-pages/home.html.twig" standalone />

## Considerations

Note the `.home` class applied to `<body>`. The `<h1>` on this template uses the larger `.txt-mercury` font-size.
