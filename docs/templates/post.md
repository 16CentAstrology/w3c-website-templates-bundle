# Post template

This example shows the minimum markup of a post template. It does not include:

- the complete [global navigation](../components/navigation.md)
- the optional [translations component](../components/translations.md)
- the complete list of site links for the [footer](../components/footer.md).

It does show the markup of the post meta details, the sidebar links to related content, and the comments section.

The beta banner is contained within `<div class="banner">` and can be removed when no longer required.

<example title="Post page" src="example-pages/post.html.twig" standalone />

## Considerations

Note the `.post` class applied to `<body>`.
