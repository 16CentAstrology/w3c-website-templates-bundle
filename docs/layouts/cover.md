# Cover

The cover layout creates a container with a minimum height to hold vertically centered content, ideal for "above the fold" hero blocks and sections needing visual prominence. It uses the classes `.l-cover` for the container and `.principal` for the content to be centred.

## Cover with horizontal centering using a utility class

<example title="Cover layout with horizontally centred content via a utility class" src="components/cover-with-utility.html.twig" />

## Cover with a nested center layout for horizontal centering

<example title="Cover layout with horizontally centred content via the center layout" src="components/cover-with-center.html.twig" />

## Cover with optional header and footer content

The following example shows how we might change the default alignment of the 'header':
